## Overview

This project involves building the back end for an e-commerce site, focusing on configuring an Express.js API to interact with a MySQL database using Sequelize. The goal is to provide the manager of an internet retail company with a back end that utilizes the latest technologies, enabling the company to compete effectively in the e-commerce market.

## Features

Using Insomnia or a similar app, you can interact with the server in the following ways:

- **View all Categories**: send a GET request with the endpoint of /api/categories/

- **View all Products**:  send a GET request with the endpoint of /api/products/

- **View all Tags**:  send a GET request with the endpoint of /api/tags/

- **View a Categories**:  send a GET request request with the endpoint of /api/categories/(category id)

- **View a Products**:  send a GET request with the endpoint of /api/products/(product id)

- **View a Tags**:  send a GET request with the endpoint of /api/tags/(tag id)

- **Add a Category**: send a POST request with the endpoint of /api/categories/ and the following req.body:
                      	
      {
        "category_name": "string"
      }

- **Add a Product**: send a POST request with the endpoint of /api/products/ and the following req.body:

        "price": string,
        "stock": string,
		"category_id": integer,
		"tagIds": [integer]
      }

- **Add an Tag**: send a POST request with the endpoint of /api/tags/ and the following req.body:
                      	
      {
        "tag_name": "string"
      }

- **Update a Category** : send a PUT request with the endpoint of /api/categories/(category id) and the following req.body:

      }

      {
        "product_name": "string",
        "price": string,
        "stock": string,
			  "category_id": integer,
			  "tagIds": [integer]
      }


- **Update an Tag**: send a PUT request with the endpoint of /api/tags/(tag id) and the following req.body:
